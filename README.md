## 🔥 News

- [2025/07/19] 🔥🔥🔥 Our github repo is released!!!

## 📖 Results

MUR reduces computation by over 50\% on average across three backbone models, while improving accuracy by 0.62–3.37\%.

🚀 Quick Start
The code will be released soon!!!

<!-- To use the MUR, we can try with the following command.

Firstly, create the environment and install the requirements. This implementation is accelerated and supported by vllm.

```bash
# env
conda create -n phi-decoding python==3.10
conda activate phi-decoding
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, simply run the following command after the basic configuration:

```bash
python phi_decoding.py
```

P.S. If you find error in running phi_decoding.py, please refer to "origin" branch. Because we are refactoring the orignal version to provide a PyPi, so temporary bug may appear in this branch. We are so sorry for that inconvenience.

## 🔧 PyPi Package

We are working on the PyPi Package of $\phi$-Decoding. Stay tuned for the updates ! You can try it with:

```bash
pip install phi-decoding
```
